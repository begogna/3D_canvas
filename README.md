# 3D_canvas
Personal project for 3D visualisation using three.js initially

I want to create a website where I can have a canvas for 3D visualisation of objects and text.
Next I want to make it interactive, so the user can write or draw something in 2D that will become 3D.
Then I want to add options to change the 3D shape in an intuitive mode in real time.
